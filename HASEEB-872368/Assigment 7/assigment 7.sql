---7.1 - Assign a sequential row number to each product ordered by list_price descending. Then assign a second row number partitioned by category_id, resetting within each category.
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    category_id,
    list_price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        ORDER BY list_price DESC
    ) AS overall_row,  
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY category_id
        ORDER BY list_price DESC
    ) AS category_row
FROM production.products;


---7.2 - Write a query that returns each product with its RANK() and DENSE_RANK() by list_price descending within its category. Show a product where the two rankings differ.

SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    category_id,
    list_price,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY category_id
        ORDER BY list_price DESC
    ) AS price_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY category_id
        ORDER BY list_price DESC
    ) AS dense_price_rank
FROM production.products;

---7.3 - Use LAG() to calculate the month-over-month revenue change for each store. Show the current month revenue, the previous month revenue, and the difference.

WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        o.store_id,
        YEAR(o.order_date) AS order_year,
        MONTH(o.order_date) AS order_month,
        SUM(i.quantity * i.list_price * (1 - i.discount)) AS current_revenue
    FROM sales.orders AS o
    JOIN sales.order_items AS i
        ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    GROUP BY
        o.store_id,
        YEAR(o.order_date),
        MONTH(o.order_date)
),
revenue_with_previous AS (
    SELECT
        store_id,
        order_year,
        order_month,
        current_revenue,

        LAG(current_revenue) OVER (
            PARTITION BY store_id
            ORDER BY order_year, order_month
        ) AS previous_month_revenue

    FROM monthly_revenue
)
SELECT
    store_id,
    order_year,
    order_month,
    current_revenue,
    previous_month_revenue,
    current_revenue - previous_month_revenue AS revenue_difference
FROM revenue_with_previous
ORDER BY store_id, order_year, order_month;

---7.4 - Use NTILE(5) to divide all products into five price bands. Return the product name, price, and band number.

SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,

    NTILE(5) OVER (
        ORDER BY list_price
    ) AS price_band

FROM production.products;




---7.5 - Write a query that shows each order with a running total of revenue ordered by order_date. Use ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

WITH order_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        SUM(i.quantity * i.list_price * (1 - i.discount)) AS revenue
    FROM sales.orders AS o
    JOIN sales.order_items AS i
        ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    GROUP BY
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date
           ) 
    SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    revenue,

    SUM(revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date, order_id
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_total_revenue

FROM order_revenue
ORDER BY order_date, order_id;

---7.6 - Think About It: Why does LAST_VALUE() require RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING to return the actual last value in the partition, while FIRST_VALUE() works correctly with the default frame? What is the default window frame when ORDER BY is specified, and how does that explain the behavior? 

SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    category_id,
    list_price,

    FIRST_VALUE(list_price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY category_id
        ORDER BY list_price
    ) AS first_price,

    LAST_VALUE(list_price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY category_id
        ORDER BY list_price
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
        AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS last_price

FROM production.products;
